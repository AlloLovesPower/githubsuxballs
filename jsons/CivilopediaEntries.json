Thinking right now how, in this mod im making for the civilizationlike game Unciv i am making it so not a single empire has any technology for cutting down trees.  Even the most baseline empires of my world preserve forests.  The mod could just be an accurate simulation of something.  But it isn't.  It is a vehicle for my ideals to reach myself and others as they have fun.

What is the vehicle upon which YOUR ideals reach their targets?  Is the medium also that which you personally most enjoy?
